# <accessability-through-semantics-refactoring>

## Description

- I wanted this website to be easier to navigate with accesibility devices, and 
for the code to be more semantically clear and understandable.
- This Update allows for greater ease of accesibility with the addition of alt tags 
for images, as well as header and footer tags for easier alternate navigation, and minor consilidation of CSS.
